# Taste of the City Food Festival Poster

## Project Overview

Taste of the City is an annual food festival celebrating the diverse culinary scene of the metropolitan area. The festival needed a poster design that would capture the excitement and variety of the event while attracting both food enthusiasts and families to attend.

## The Challenge

The client needed a poster design that would:

- Appeal to diverse audiences (foodies, families, tourists)
- Stand out in busy urban environments
- Work across multiple sizes and formats

- Generate excitement and anticipation for the event
