# Green Energy Marketing Campaign

## Project Overview

EcoPower Solutions is a leading renewable energy company that needed a comprehensive marketing campaign to promote their solar and wind energy solutions. The campaign targeted both residential and commercial customers, emphasizing environmental benefits and cost savings.

## The Challenge

The client needed a marketing campaign that would:

- Educate the public about renewable energy benefits
- Generate qualified leads for solar installations
- Build trust and credibility in the local community
- Differentiate from competitors in the growing green energy market
- Work across multiple print and outdoor media formats

## Our Solution

### Campaign Strategy

We developed a multi-channel approach focusing on:

- **Educational Content**: Brochures explaining solar benefits and ROI
- **Outdoor Advertising**: Billboards and transit ads in high-traffic areas
- **Direct Mail**: Targeted postcards to homeowners in solar-friendly neighborhoods
- **Trade Show Materials**: Professional displays and handouts for industry events

### Visual Identity

The campaign used a nature-inspired design system:

- **Color Palette**: Earthy greens, sky blues, and warm yellows
- **Imagery**: High-quality photos of solar panels, wind turbines, and happy families
- **Typography**: Clean, modern fonts that convey trust and innovation
- **Icons**: Custom illustrations of renewable energy concepts

### Key Materials Created

- **Invitations**: Open house events for solar installations

## Implementation

### Print Production

- **Paper Selection**: Sustainable, FSC-certified papers for environmental alignment
- **Ink Choices**: Soy-based inks for reduced environmental impact
- **Finishing**: UV coating and embossing for premium feel
- **Quantity Management**: Strategic printing to minimize waste

### Distribution Strategy
